              About Pizza Wizard
            </h2>
            <p>
              The founder of this enterprise is the all-mighty pizza wizard, Dumbledough. For centuries, Dumbledough has been
              making magical pizzas. He used to be headmaster of Hogwash School of Bitchcraft and Pizardry, a post he held for 2&#960; years.
              However, now that he has retired he wishes to spread wonder and happiness to the world by taking his
              pizza business online. With the help of a group of IT students, that wish came true as Pizza Wizard
              (a.k.a. PizWiz) was born.

              Pizza Wizard offers services for everyone. In addition to a standard menu of our favourite pizzas,
              we also offer you, the customer, the possibility to design your own pizza or, to spice it up, to generate randomly
              designed pizzas! For the magic of it, the website also includes secret discounts, but this is very hush-hush.
